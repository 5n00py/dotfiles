# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are the configuration 
files for various tools and applications that I use in my development 
environment.

These dotfiles are tailored to my workflow, preferences, and productivity 
needs, and I'm sharing them here in the hope that they can be useful to others 
as well and to have a remote backup ;-).

The dotfiles are somewhat tailored together to provide a streamlined experience, 
with configurations that complement each other and try to mimic consistent 
behavior across different tools. By using these dotfiles, you can benefit from 
a cohesive and familiar environment that enhances productivity and efficiency.

## Features

- **Zsh Configuration**: The repository includes my Zsh configuration 
files located in the `zsh`. Refer to 
[zsh-config-doc.pdf](zsh/doc/zsh-config-doc.pdf) for further information.

-  **Tmux Configuration**: The repository includes my tmux configuration files, 
located in the `tmux` directory. For more information, refer to the 
[tmux-config-doc.pdf](tmux/doc/tmux-config-doc.pdf) document.

However, keep in mind that these dotfiles are tailored to my specific needs and 
may require adjustments to fit your own environment.

   directory.
