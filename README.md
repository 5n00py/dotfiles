# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which consist of configuration
files for various tools and applications that I utilize in my development
environment. These dotfiles are specifically tailored to align with my
workflow, preferences, and productivity needs. I am sharing them here with the
intention that they can be valuable to others and serve as a remote backup.

The dotfiles within this repository are designed to work harmoniously,
providing a cohesive and streamlined experience. They have been carefully
configured to complement each other and establish consistent behavior across
different tools. By utilizing these dotfiles, you can benefit from a unified
and familiar environment that enhances your productivity and efficiency.

Feel free to modify and customize these dotfiles to suit your own requirements 
and preferences.

may require adjustments to fit your own environment.

To use these dotfiles:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine into the home directory:
   ```bash
    git clone --bare https://www.github.com/5n00py/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles.git
    echo ".dotfiles.git" >> .gitignore
    dotfiles checkout
    dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
      ```

run source ~/.zshrc for Zsh).

## Purpose

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are configuration files
primarily tailored for programming in Rust, C, Python, and Shell scripting.
These dotfiles provide a customized environment optimized for my development
workflow and preferences.

The dotfiles are organized into separate directories and files, following a
modularization approach. While they may not be as "dotty" as before, they
try retain their purpose.

## Manage Dotfiles With a Bare Git Repository

For more detailed information on how to manage dotfiles in a bare git
repository, please refer to this [post by Nicola
Paolucci](https://harfangk.github.io/2016/09/18/manage-dotfiles-with-a-git-bare-repository.html).

## Compatibility

Although I am primarily working on Ubuntu, many aspects of these dotfiles
should work across different Linux distributions and other Unix-like systems.
However, please note that certain configurations or dependencies may be
specific to Ubuntu or require additional setup on other platforms.

## Contributing

Although these dotfiles reflect my personal preferences and workflow, I welcome
contributions and suggestions that can improve their usability and effectiveness.
If you have any ideas, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue
or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

I've been inspired and influenced by various dotfiles repositories and
open-source projects. I want to express my gratitude to the creators and
contributors of those projects for their valuable contributions to the
developer community.
