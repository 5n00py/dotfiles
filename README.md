# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are the configuration 
files for various tools and applications that I use in my development 
environment.

These dotfiles are tailored to my workflow, preferences, and productivity 
needs, and I'm sharing them here in the hope that they can be useful to others 
as well and to have a remote backup ;-).

## Features

- **Zsh Configuration**: The repository includes my custom Zsh configuration 
files. Refer to [zsh-config-doc.pdf](zsh/doc/zsh-config-doc.pdf) for further
information.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these dotfiles according to your own preferences. 
However, keep in mind that these dotfiles are tailored to my specific needs and 
may require adjustments to fit your own environment.

To use these dotfiles:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine into the home directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git ~/Dotfiles
   ```

2. Review the dotfiles and customize them as needed.

3. Create symbolic links that point to the respecive files in the dotfiles
   directory.

4. Install relevant dependencies

5. Reload or restart the relevant applications (e.g., restart the terminal or 
run source ~/.zshrc for Zsh).

## Contributing

Although these dotfiles reflect my personal preferences and workflow, I welcome 
contributions and suggestions that can improve their usability and effectiveness. 
If you have any ideas, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue 
or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements
