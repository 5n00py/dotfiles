# Note: cmus automatically saves settings to the ~/.config/cmus/autosave file 
# when quitting the program. This autosave file will include settings changes 
# you made during your cmus session, even if they weren't added to the rc file. 
# If you want to prevent cmus from saving settings automatically, you can use
#:set autosave=false 
# If you want to completely reset your cmus settings, you can delete the 
# autosave file and then restart cmus.

# This sets the output plugin to ALSA. This is necessary when wanting to 
# directly interface with your hardware without the overhead of audio servers 
# like PulseAudio.
# It might result in lower latency and better compatibility with certain audio
# devices.
# Note: You would typically use this if you are not using Bluetooth or other 
# devices managed by PulseAudio.
set output_plugin=alsa

# This sets the ALSA device to be used for audio output to the 'default' device. 
# The 'default' device is defined in your ALSA configuration.

# This sets the ALSA device to be used for volume control to the 'default' device. 
# The 'default' device is defined in your ALSA configuration.
set mixer.alsa.device=default

# This sets the ALSA channel to be used for volume control. The 'Master' 
# channel is typically the main output volume for your system.
set mixer.alsa.channel=Master

# Expand the list of albums for an artist in the library view when the artist

# Set cmus to use the PulseAudio output plugin. This might be necessary when using
# Bluetooth headphones or other devices that are managed by PulseAudio.
