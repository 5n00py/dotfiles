# TPM handles the installation, updating and initialization of plugins.
# To install TPM, follow instructions at https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm or
# directly do 
# 'git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm'

# In order to install the plugins press prefix + I. This is the TPM command to
# install new plugins.

# After doing this, the plugins should be downloaded and installed into the 
# ~/.tmux/plugins/ directory. You can check if the operation was successful by 
# running 'ls ~/.tmux/plugins/'. 
# At least the directories for tmux-sensible, tmux-resurrect, and tmux-continuum 
# should be present after the these setups.

set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
