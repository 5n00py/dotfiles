# tmux-resurrect provides a way to save and restore tmux sessions across system
# reboots. This includes all windows, panes, their order, current working 
# directories, and even pane content.
# To use tmux-resurrect, press prefix + Ctrl-s to save and prefix + Ctrl-r to 
# restore.
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'

# Restoring vim and neovim sessions
# Recommended by maintainer:
# [tpope/vim-obsession](https://github.com/ tpope/vim-obsession) (as almost every
# plugin, it works for both vim and neovim).
# for vim
set -g @resurrect-strategy-vim 'session'
# for neovim
set -g @resurrect-strategy-nvim 'session'

# tmux-resurrect will now restore vim and neovim sessions if `Session.vim` 
# file is present.

# Mimic Vim's ':w' command to save the current tmux session. 
# By pressing 'prefix + w', tmux-resurrect's save script is invoked, preserving 
# the session, windows, and panes.
